I'm now a second-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, advised by [Quanquan Gu](https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~qgu/). I am broadly interested in generative models, the foundation of machine learning, and AI for health. I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from Tsinghua University in 2018.
