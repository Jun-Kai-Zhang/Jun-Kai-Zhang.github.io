## Projects

### Fast Sampling Via De-randomization for Discrete Diffusion Models
*<p style="text-align:left;">Prof. Quanquan Gu<span style="float:right;">Jul. 2023 - Current</span></p>*


- Proposed a novel non-markov discrete diffusion process by introducing transition time set. Significantly reduced the number of function evaluations required during the reverse process, achieving up to a $30\times$ speedup in sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality.

- Developed a continuous-time (infinite-step) sampling algorithm capable of generating even higher-quality samples compared to its discrete-time (finite-step) counterpart.

### Continuous Treatment Effect Modeling in Multi-agent Dynamical Systems
*<p style="text-align:left;">Prof. Quanquan Gu, Prof. Dominik Wodarz, Prof. Yizhou Sun, Prof. Wei Wang<span style="float:right;">Nov. 2022 - Current</span></p>*

- Launched the interdisciplinary project towards explainable AI for health using multi-source data, supported by NSF 21590.

- Utilized graph-structured neural ODEs to capture the coupled evolution of vertices and edges in multi-agent dynamic systems. Incorporated treatments into the ODE by learning a time-dependent representations using attention mechanism.

- Proposed domain adversarial training objectives to mitigate confounding bias and improve predictions, outperforming all baselines in COVID-19 dataset and tumor growth simulation dataset.

### Temporal Modeling and Prediction of Recurrent COVID-19 Infections
*<p style="text-align:left;">Guide: Prof. Quanquan Gu<span style="float:right;">Dec. 2022 - Mar. 2023</span></p>*

- Collaborated with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to tackle the ongoing challenge of recurrent COVID-19 infections in the post-pandemic era.
- Developed a novel variant of the SEIR epidemiological model to quantitatively assess the number of  first-time and recurring infection cases. 
- Employed machine learning techniques to optimize the parameters of the differential equations in the SEIR-based model, achieving both accurate and interpretable predictions.


### Response Subject Discrimination during Multi-device Human-computer Interaction
*<p style="text-align:left;">Guide: Prof. Yuntao Wang<span style="float:right;">Jun. 2021 - Dec. 2021</span></p>*

- Employed physical properties inspired machine learning techniques to extract acoustic features of wake-up words voice recordings.

- Utilized Bayesian network to integrate information from each individual microphone arrays for robust and accurate subject discrimination.
