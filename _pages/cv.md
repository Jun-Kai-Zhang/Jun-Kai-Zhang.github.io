## Projects
### Temporal Modeling and Prediction of Recurrent COVID-19 Infections
<p style="text-align:left;">Guide: Prof. Quanquan Gu<span style="float:right;">Dec. 2022 - Mar. 2023</span></p>

- Collaborated with Cedars-Sinai Medical Center to tackle the ongoing challenge of recurrent COVID-19 infections in the post-pandemic era.
- Developed a novel variant of the SEIR epidemiological model to quantitatively assess the number of  first-time and recurring infection cases. 
- Employed machine learning techniques to optimize the parameters of the differential equations in the SEIR-based model, achieving both accurate and interpretable predictions.


### Response Subject Discrimination during Multi-device Human-computer Interaction
<p style="text-align:left;">Guide: Prof. Yuntao Wang<span style="float:right;">Jun. 2021 - Dec. 2021</span></p>

- Employed physical properties inspired machine learning techniques to extract acoustic features of wake-up words voice recordings.

- Utilized Bayesian network to integrate information from each individual microphone arrays for robust and accurate subject discrimination.
