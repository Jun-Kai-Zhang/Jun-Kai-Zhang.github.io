  - Proposed an algorithm for reward-free exploration in the linear mixture MDP setting. The algorithm guided the agent to collect samples using a exploration-driven pseudo-reward function.
  - Rigorously proved that our algorithm can achieve a horizon-free sample complexity based on high-order moment estimation that precisely controls the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
  - Established the theoretical lower bound for reward-free algorithm in linear mixture MDP, which matches our upper bound and further proved the optimality of our algorithm.
